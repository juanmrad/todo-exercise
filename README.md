# Todo List application with express

Build a todo list application using Node.JS and express that will allow me to interact with my own todo list.

Build the following endpoints:

### GET /api/todos

Get all the items from my todo list.

### GET /api/todos/:id

Get a specific todo item with that id

### POST /api/todos

Create a new todo list item with the passed in todo item. ( hint. make sure that the ids are formatted appropriately to to avoid having issues of multiple items having the same id)

### PUT /api/todos/:id

Modify/mutate a specific todo list item by the id.

### DELETE /api/todos/:id

Delete a specific todo list item.
